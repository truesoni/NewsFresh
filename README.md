# NewsFresh
NewsFresh app to stay updated with the latest news.

Summary: 
I've created this repo to learn how the basics of the Android recycler view work in Kotlin, which helps me integrate the news API with the News app.

Working:
The main-Activity acts as Launcher Activity, in which the recycler view adapter fetches the top news and shows it to the users.
If they are interested then using web view they can get full insights of the selected news from the listed news.
